Problem Statement
      
      Analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global employment by examining trends in layoffs across industries, countries, and time periods. Identify the most affected industries and regions and explore potential factors contributing to the job losses. Develop insights for policymakers and business leaders to mitigate the economic impact of future pandemics and crises 

Description Of The Project

    The project typically starts with collecting data on layoffs from kaggle. The data includes information on the number of layoffs, the industries and companies affected, and the demographic characteristics of affected employees.

    Once the data has been collected, the next step is to analyze it using various statistical and data analysis techniques. This involves identifying trends and patterns in the data, such as which industries or regions have been most affected by layoffs, or which types of employees are most likely to be laid off. The analysis also involves looking for correlations between different factors, such as the relationship between layoffs and economic indicators like GDP or unemployment rates.

    Finally, the project may help making recommendations or proposing solutions based on the analysis. For example, the project may suggest policies or initiatives that could help reduce the number of layoffs in the future, or provide guidance to affected employees on how to find new job opportunities or reskill for new careers.
    
    Overall, this layoffs data analysis project can be a valuable tool for gaining insights into the complex and often difficult issue of layoffs and their impact on individuals, communities, and the economy.
